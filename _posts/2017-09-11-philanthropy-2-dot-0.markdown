The truth is most corporations/big business do spend money on philanthropy. 

What if you create a philanthropic organisation that created multiple sustainable revenue generating businesses that were aimed at either environmental or social remediation in some way?

So in this model, philanthropy and conscious development create a wrapper for traditional revenue models. This could potentially work with open or closed source development. If closed-source, the parent organisation maintains ownership of related patents and licences the tech to its sub-companies.
