The truth is most corporations/big business do spend money on philanthropy. This is not the problem. The problem is that it's an afterthought.

What if you create a philanthropic organisation that is dedicated to positive probability shifting, but also focused on creating multiple sustainable revenue generating businesses that are designed to be environmentally sustainable or socially innovative?

So in this model, philanthropy and conscious development create a wrapper for traditional revenue models. This could potentially work with open or closed source development. If closed-source, the parent organisation maintains ownership of related patents and licences the IP to its sub-companies.
