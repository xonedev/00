title: What is money and how much do we need?

Money = Energy.

Plain and simple. Human, animal and mineral energy is converted into money through work or commodity. Soul-spirit matrix is turned into zero's and one's.

Okay now that we have that out the way. Let's determine how much we need, given three scenarios:

1) A person who likes to keep things simple, has basic material needs and doesn't fuss too much about living it large.
2) A person with ambition that wants to make an impact in the world.
3) Egomaniacs that want to completely take over the world, for whatever reason*.

This post is mostly concerned with #2 & #3.
The three cases presented have vastly different energy requirements. The difference between #3 & #2 is much larger than between #2 & #1.

Do we need to be billionaires or trillionaires to make a big impact? At what point do the numbers start to become irrelevant? 

If you're in category 2, that's a safe space to be. Let's assume to be completely satisfied, even with great ambition, you could settle for a net worth of 100 million dollars at your peak. For case #2, In what scenario does this amount of energy not satisfy your need to make that big impact and live a very comfortable life?

If a project requires larger funding, you create a collective of investors. This way no single entity has too much power, it's democratic.

Case #3, from what I can gather, these people are in competition with each other to see who can make it to the top of the Forbes richest list. The energy requirement of #3 is what I consider the root of most problems we face as a civilisation. Choices that harm our collective environment are prioritized over those that may be beneficial for the collective environment.

Money seems to be an addiction to some, and it becomes worse when an inflated and uncontrolled ego is steering it.

If we temper our need for total domination (#3), things get a lot more sustainable, and a lot friendlier in the long run.

Maybe I'm missing something, if so please enlighten me.
