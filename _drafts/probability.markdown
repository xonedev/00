Every choice you make shifts the probability matrix ("the field") that defines not only your life, but the collective as well. *The field* doesn't end in your neighbourhood, city, country, continent or planet.

*We are all connected and the field is powerful.*

Some people have a greater ability to shift the field than others, and it is on these people we are depending to make the right choices at this point in time, to put their accumulated energy to work for our highest potential as a civilisation.

You might not have known it then, but you are probably starting to understand how action needs to be taken to ensure the reality we're creating on a collective level is one we would all want to live in.

We are waiting and ready. Let's start shifting.
