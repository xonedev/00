In an ideal world, we wouldn't need patents. 

We'd have access to a library of technologies ( refined to a state of optimum function ), and a system to track who is building what. We would have everything we need, and less competition.

But in this reality we find ourselves in, plagued by patent trolls, we need to protect certain ideas in order to make them attractive to investment funds.

Sometimes patenting is necessary primarily to protect against predatory patent trolls, even if the plan is to eventually go open-source or donate the patents to the world like Tesla Motors did.
